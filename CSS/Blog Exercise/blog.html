		<h1>Visit Beijing part 1</h1>
		<h3>Best Time To Visit</h3>
		<p>The best times to visit Beijing are autumn and late spring, which bring clear skies, mild temperatures, and resplendent flora. Crowds are thick during the October holidays (October 1 through 7) and Spring Festival (late January to mid-February, depending on the lunar calendar).</p>
		<h3>Beijing Transportation</h3>
		<P>The subway is the cheapest way to get around (a one-way trip starts at about $0.30). Taxis are plentiful and cheap, though cycling is arguably the best way to see the city, especially if you’re staying in an area with many hutongs.</P>
		<h3>Beijing Weather</h3>
		<p>July is the hottest month, with an average high of 81°F (27°C), and January is the coldest, with an average high of 25°F (-4°C).</p>
